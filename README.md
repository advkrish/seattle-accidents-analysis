# seattle-accidents-analysis
This project analyzes accidents in Seattle.

Findings:
“N NORTHGATE WAY BETWEEN MERIDIAN AVE N AND CORLISS AVE N” (317 collisions) This is the street with the highest collisions count. This is most likely because That stretch isa high-traffic arterial near the Northgate Mall and I-5 access, meaning a mix of through-traffic, local shoppers, and buses
Steady ~12K–16K collisions per year from 2004–2019 on average
Notable dip in 2020 (7,250 collisions) Most likely due to Covid outbreaks. COVID lockdowns dramatically reduced commuting, nightlife, and tourism, cutting vehicle miles traveled.
October has the most collisions(22,167), but February has the least(17,796). October coincides with darker commutes, wetter road surfaces from fall rains, and the return of school traffic after summer. February, though still wet, often has fewer events, less tourist traffic, and sometimes snow/ice days where people stay home, reducing exposure.
Property Damage Only was the highest at : 149,578 accidents, followed by Injury Collisions at 64,172. Most collisions are low-speed impacts such as parking lot bumps or sideswipes that don’t injure occupants. Modern vehicles have better crash protection, so many incidents that might have caused injury decades ago now result in property damage only.
The highest number of accidents happend to Parked Cars – 51,244 accidents. Dense urban parking on narrow streets means many vehicles are parallel parked next to active travel lanes. Drivers misjudging distances, opening doors into traffic, or scraping while parking account for a large share of such incidents. Delivery vehicles, snowplows, and distracted drivers can also contribute.
